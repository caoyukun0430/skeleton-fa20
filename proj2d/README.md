# Porject 2 Implementation

Hi, this is Yukun's solutions for Project 2D of part I to IV following https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2d/proj2d.

## How to Play

Besides folking my codes and run the codes/server locally, I have followed instructs https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2d/heroku
and prepared the JAR file and one running version in Heroku.

You can find my JAR file in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eUgYLV79QQvrgcadJBXUQ_CEarrHTrCk/view?usp=sharing

Or quickly check http://bearmaps-fa20proj2d-yukun.herokuapp.com/map.html where I deployed one running bearmap application for you to play around quickly!

ENJOY CODING!
